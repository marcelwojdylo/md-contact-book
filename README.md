# Contact book
A simple contact book written in plain Java
## Description
Meant as an excercise in the basics of Java, as an opportunity to apply what I learned while reading *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* Has a simple Swing interface. Allows the user to view, create, edit and delete contacts, which are stored in a JSON file.
